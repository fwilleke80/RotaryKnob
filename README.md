# RotaryKnob CustomGUI

This project creates a CustomGUI for the already existing REAL datatype (in XPresso, User Data, et cetera). Maybe not super useful in everyday production life, but quite instructive for aspiring CustomGUI developers.

This plugin demonstrates the following C4D API aspects:
* Implementing a CustomGUI, derived from `class iCustomGui`
* Integrating a CustomGUI in Cinema 4D, using `class CustomGuiData`
* Drawing custom GUI elements with `class GeUserArea` and `class GeClipMap`
* Introducing custom properties to a CustomGUI using `struct CustomProperty`
